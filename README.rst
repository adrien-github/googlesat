Google Satellite integration into KDE marble
=================================================

The french community did a very good job at providing an `OpenStreetMap rendering <http://tile.openstreetmap.fr/>`_ well adapted for french people.

This provides an integration of Google Satellite for the virtual globe `Marble <https://marble.kde.org/>`_ from KDE.

It uses the Satellite view, as well as the street and traffic layers.

Any improvement is welcome!
